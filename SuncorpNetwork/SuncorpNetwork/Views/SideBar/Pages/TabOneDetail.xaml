How much is enough?

While most people have some level of life insurance within their super fund, often it’s not enough. Likewise, insurance you bought years ago may no longer meet your needs, particularly if you’ve had major life changes such as a new job, new house or you’ve had a child.

How much life insurance you’ll need depends largely on your personal situation. In most cases you should select an amount of cover that can help your family:

Pay off the mortgage and other debts
Meet ongoing household expenses
Pay for your children’s education
Pay for extra child care or home services
Cover the cost of funeral expenses
To discuss the level of life insurance that’s right for you, make an appointment with a Suncorp Financial Adviser.

What does it cost?

The cost of life insurance varies based on a range of factors including your age, gender, and the amount of cover you require. As an example, for the equivalent of $1.96 a day a 40 year old non-smoking man could buy a policy that pays a benefit of around $1.13 million*.

* Based on an Asteron Life Complete policy for a non-smoking man age 40, with premiums paid annually.
